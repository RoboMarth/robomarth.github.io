							<h2>Colorado Sky</h2>
							<p>Sky (as in Rocky Mountain High, Sky) with a piece of the Colorado State Capitol. Like a wrapped chocolate I guess. (July 2017)</p>

							<h2>Video Game Walk</h2>
							<p>Hell, I feel like most video games have a better sense of depth than this picture. Or maybe my eyes are just finally going, going away, off to see another day. (July 2017)</p>
